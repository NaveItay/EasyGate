            <div class="container">
                <h2>WHY EASYGATE?</h2>
                <p>Unlike systems that rely on cameras to detect vehicle license plates, which can be easily manipulated
                    by changing the license plate number, EasyGate offers a more secure and discreet solution.</p>
                <p>While other companies’ systems rely on visible recognition, EasyGate operates "silently," with
                    encrypted, unseen communication, making it ideal for sensitive locations.</p>
                <p>As more vehicles take to the roads and parking spaces become scarce, incidents of gate break-ins
                    using generic tools have increased. These tools attempt to exploit hardcoded vulnerabilities to gain
                    unauthorized access.</p>
                <p>EasyGate’s unique encryption technology ensures that access to the premises is fully protected,
                    making it impossible to bypass through generic tools or traditional methods.</p>
